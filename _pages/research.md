Close your eyes and think of Leonardo da Vinci’s Monna Lisa. Is she looking at you or not? Is her hair curled or straight? Visual Mental Imagery (VMI) is the set of abilities whereby we can “see” things that are elsewhere (or nowhere: now imagine Monna Lisa frowning at you).

## About us  
Our research project on visual mental imagery led by **Pr. Paolo Bartolomeo** in PICNIC lab at Paris Brain Institute.

**PICNIC Lab: Physiological Investigations of Clinically Normal and Impaired Cognition**

The team led by Laurent Cohen, Lionel Naccache and Paolo Bartolomeo is devoted to the study of cognitive functions with an exclusive or prevalent development in humans, namely language and conscious cognition.  
They focus their research on:

- The generality of conscious access, the relationships between brain-body interactions and states-of-consciousness, the exploration of stream of consciousness through the dynamics of conscious states. The team will design patterns of brain stimulation to improve conscious state of non-communicating patients, and implement a novel translational tool for real time and web based metrics of consciousness for clinical care.
- Cognitive functions and brain plasticity, investigating the cerebral mechanisms of word reading, as well as the novel functions of the visual cortex of congenitally blind individuals.
- Investigation of the precise dynamics of fronto-parietal networks that control visuospatial attention.
