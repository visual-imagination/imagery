Battery of visual imagery and perception

**Pour version fran√ßaise [ici](/imagination/games/Games-BIP2-fr/)**

### A new battery to assess the ability to generate mental images in different areas
Did you know? About 2-3% of the population can not imagine. Yes! He couldn't even imagine his girlfriend's face! We call it [*aphantasia*](/posts/Posts-Aphantasia/). These people may find it difficult to imagine objects, faces, colors or letters, etc.

In our visual mental imagery (VMI) research project, we built a test battery that contains more domains, including a vividness test. You can test your ability to generate mental images.

Share this test with your friends and family. We hopefully wish that one day we will understand how the brain create mental images and why some people don't have mental images.
